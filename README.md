# ChillZone Configurations

This repo contains all the ChillZone SMP Configurations, kept up to date.

We keep this publicly viewable for transparency purposes, as we aim to be a server ran by the community and this allows you to have a say into another significant part of the server.



## Contributing

If you see a value you'd like changed in a configuration file, please open a PR (Pull Request) and we'll look into merging your request. Please note, we cannot guarantee we can do every change - for the server to handle the player counts we hit some compromises are required. 


## Appendix

Not all values will be visible, some will show "REDACTED". These are hidden intentionally. They will not be shown publicly so do not bother asking. These will be sensitive values we can't publicly disclose.
